# Research: Conduct Competitive Pricing Analysis for Hermes

## Objective

We need to establish the final pricing for the Hermes service. The goal is to position it as a premium product, with pricing approximately 20% above the average market rate for similar AI legal assistant tools.

## Tasks

- [ ] Identify 3-5 key competitors in the legal AI/virtual receptionist space
- [ ] Research and document their current pricing models (e.g., per user, per call, tiered subscriptions)
- [ ] Analyze the core features offered at each price point
- [ ] Summarize the findings in a new document

## Deliverable

The final output should be a markdown file named `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md` in the `/docs` directory, containing a table that compares Hermes' proposed features against the competitors' features and pricing.
