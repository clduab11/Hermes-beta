# 🚨 CRITICAL: CI/CD GitHub Actions Workflow Failures - 4 Failed Checks Resolved

## 📋 Issue Summary

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Type**: CI/CD Bug / Technical Debt  
**Impact**: GitHub Pages deployment and accessibility auditing

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The main branch workflow was failing due to **hardcoded repository URLs** using obsolete "Hermes-beta" naming instead of the correct "hermes-agent" repository name.

### Specific Failures Identified:
1. ❌ **Lighthouse Performance Audit** - 404 errors on hardcoded URLs
2. ❌ **Accessibility Validation** - Could not reach deployment site  
3. ❌ **GitHub Pages Verification** - Wrong URL references
4. ❌ **Legal Compliance Checks** - URL mismatch preventing validation

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### Primary Fixes:
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE (Broken)
